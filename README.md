# StreamCheck

DISCLAIMER: THIS PROJECT WAS CREATED 100% USING AI. I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO CODE :)

PowerShell script to analyze video streams from an m3u_plus playlist by measuring bitrate, resolution, and FPS using `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`.

## Requirements

- Windows PowerShell 5.1  
- `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` placed in the `.\bin` folder relative to the script  
- Execution policy that allows running unsigned scripts (e.g., `RemoteSigned` or `Bypass`)

## Usage

- Give the unsigned script permission to run
```powershell
Unblock-File -Path ".\streamcheck.ps1"
```

```powershell
.\streamcheck.ps1 -m3u <path_to_playlist.m3u> [-DurationSeconds <seconds>]
```
- m3u (required): Path to the m3u_plus playlist file  
- DurationSeconds (optional): Number of seconds to test each stream (default 6 seconds)

## Output 

For each channel, the script displays: 

- Channel Name  
- Channel Group (from group-title attribute)  
- Bitrate in kbps with captured file size  
- Video Resolution (width√óheight)  
- Video FPS
     
Errors for unavailable streams are clearly indicated. 

Contributions and issue reports are welcome!
